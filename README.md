# Keeper Secrets Manager : Google SCIM Push

This repository contains the source code that synchronizes Google Workspace Users/Groups and Keeper Enterprise Users/Teams. This is necessary because Google Workspace does not adequately support Team SCIM provisioning.

## Step by Step Instructions
Read this document: [Google Workspace User and Group Provisioning with Cloud Function](https://docs.keeper.io/en/sso-connect-cloud/identity-provider-setup/g-suite-keeper/google-workspace-user-and-group-provisioning-with-cloud-function)

> This project replicates the `keeper scim push --source=google` [Commander CLI command](https://docs.keeper.io/en/keeperpam/commander-cli/command-reference/enterprise-management-commands/scim-push-configuration) and shares configuration settings with this command.

### Prerequisites
* Keeper Secret Manager enterprise subscription

### Prepare KSM application
  * Create KSM application or reuse the existing one
  * Share the SCIM configuration record with this KSM application
  * `Add Device` and make sure method is `Configuration File` Base64 encoding.

### Configuration with `gcloud`
1. Clone this repository locally
2. Copy `.env.yaml.sample` to `.env.yaml`
3. Edit `.env.yaml`
   * Set `KSM_CONFIG_BASE64` to the content of the KSM configuration file generated at the previous step
   * Set `KSM_RECORD_UID` to configuration record UID created for Commander's `scim push` command
4. Create Google Cloud function. Replace `<REGION>` placeholder with the GCP region. 
```shell
gcloud functions deploy <PickUniqueFunctionName> \
--gen2 \
--runtime=go121 \
--max-instances=1 \
--memory=512M \
--env-vars-file .env.yaml \
--region=<REGION> \
--timeout=120s \
--source=. \
--entry-point=GcpScimSyncHttp \
--trigger-http \
--no-allow-unauthenticated
```

### Configuration with `Google Console`
1. Clone this repository locally
2. Create `source.zip` file that contains "*.go" and "go.*" matches
```shell
zip source.zip `find . -name "*.go"`
zip source.zip `find . -name "go.*"`
```
3. Login to Google Console
4. Create a new function ![Create New Function](./images/create_new_function.png)
![Create Step 1](./images/create_step1.png)
![Create Step 2](./images/create_step2.png)
![Create Step 3](./images/create_step3.png)
   * Set `KSM_CONFIG_BASE64` to the content of the KSM configuration file generated at the previous step
   * Set `KSM_RECORD_UID` to configuration record UID created for Commander's `scim push` command
5. Click `NEXT`
6. Set "Entry point" to `GcpScimSyncHttp`
7. Upload the source code using `source.zip`. "Destination bucket" can be any.

8. Click `DEPLOY`

### Create Cloud Scheduler with `Google Console`
1. Find the created function and copy function URL to the clipboard
   ![Copy URL](./images/copy_url.png)

2. Search for `scheduler` and select `Cloud Scheduler`
3. Click `CREATE JOB`. `15 * * * *` means every hour at 15th minute

4. Grant the scheduler access to SCIM function

5. Create Scheduler and check it works by clicking `FORCE RUN`
